# Contributing to YogiCast

We love your input! We want to make contributing to YogiCast as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

- Follow the Flutter/Dart style guide
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use proper indentation

## Testing

- Write unit tests for services and providers
- Write widget tests for UI components
- Test error cases and edge conditions
- Maintain test coverage

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if needed
2. Update the documentation with details of any changes to the interface
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of other developers

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/yourusername/yogicast/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/yogicast/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
